        <h1>Dear Crush,</h1>
        <h4><p> How many times have I thought about us? Always imagining myself with you. I see the both of us laughing as we don't give a damm. Complementing your face even though I have said it a million times. Teasing you about your face even though it's so damn fine. Never have I ever looked at anyone like this. And well, I think you're gonna be the last. <br>
            <br>
            I've always asked myself why haven't I asked you out yet. The reason's simple really, it's because you don't feel the same way. I understand. You're way beyond my league. What could I even offer that could change your mind? All I know is, even if I try, I know it's futile.<br>
            <br>
            I should really be moving on to be honest. You've expressed countless of times that I'm nothing to you but a friend. I'm not mad or anything. I'm really hoping that someday, you might look at me at a different angle. Just know I'll be here, if that time comes. And all I can really say to you are the first letters in each paragraph because I don't know how to be THAT close to you.<br>
