        <h1>Dear Ex,</h1>
        <h4><p> As I reminisce our past, <br>
I always thought, <br>
We were having a blast. <br>
But I guess not. <br>
<br>
As I contemplate our fight, <br>
I always surrender. <br>
Because I don’t care who’s right, <br>
I just want us to be together. <br>
<br>
Now that it’s over, <br>
I always wish I could’ve done better. <br>
Be my real self this time. <br>
But all I can do now is make this poem rhyme. <br>
<br>
Not being able to talk to you, <br>
Is so suffocating. <br>
All I see is black and no hue, <br>
And thats not a fun thing. <br>
<br>
I mean, this is nothing new. <br>
But all I wanted was to be with you. <br>
Now that its not possible, <br>
I guess this pain is acceptable. <br>
<br>
As I think about us, <br>
I always end up going to our chatbox. <br>
And see those words that hit me like a bus. <br>
The feeling just sucks.</p> </h4>
