        <h1>Dear Self,</h1>
        <h4><p> First, give yourself a pat. I know, I know. You don't need it naman diba? Because you only deserve a pat if you did something good. BUT you did!! Every day you try your best to make people smile and you should be proud of it! Akala mo dahil sa acads noh? Well, sa panaginip lang natin yun hahaha.<br>
            <br>
            Second, try mo rin mag-open up sa iba :). Alam ko medyo mahirap since hindi ka pa sure kung paano nila tatanggapin mga sasabihin mo pero I think they'll understand your situation parin. You've met a lot of good people in your life and honestly, sinasayang mo kasi you barely communicate with them. I just hope sa future, you'll do well especially in keeping friendships. <br>
            <br>
            Lastly, stay loyal na! HAHAHA. I know you already have your eyes on a particular girl and I do hope magstick na for once. We both know she's your type pero this time, you're thinking bout the consequences. Which is good rin, shows how much you've matured. Pero whatever happens, don't fuck this up na. </p> </h4>
